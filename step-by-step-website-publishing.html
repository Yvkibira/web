   <h1>A Step-by-Step Guide to Publishing Your Website to the Internet</h1>
  <p> Publishing a website on the internet can be an exciting and rewarding experience. Not only can you share your content with the world, but you can also showcase your technical skills by creating and publishing your website from scratch. In this article, we will go through the steps of how to publish a website on the internet, starting from coding in VS Code to using Github Pages.</p><br>

Step 1: <h2>Choose Your Tools</h2>
<br>
<p>The first step to creating a website is to choose the right tools for the job. While there are many web development tools available, we recommend using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> (VS Code) as your code editor. VS Code is a free, open-source code editor that is widely used by web developers. It comes with many useful features, including syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools. For android you can use <a href="https://www.pioneerblogspot.co.ke/mobile-html-editor.html">treb edit</a></p><br>
Step 2:<h2> Write Your Code</h2>
<br>
<p>Once you have chosen your code editor, it's time to start writing your code. You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create your website. HTML is used for the structure of the website, CSS is used for styling, and JavaScript is used for interactivity.</p><br>

 <br>
Step 3:<h2> Test Your Website Locally</h2>
<p>
Before publishing your website, it's important to test it locally to ensure that everything is working correctly. You can do this by opening your HTML file in a web browser. This will give you a preview of how your website will look and behave when it's published.</p><br>

Step 4:<h2> Create a Github Account</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com">Github</a> is a popular platform used by developers to host and share their code. You can create a Github account for free and use it to host your website.</p><br>

Step 5:<h2> Create a New Github Repository</h2>
<p>
Once you have a Github account, you can create a new repository for your website. A repository is a place where you can store and manage your code. To create a new repository, click on the "New" button in your Github account and give your repository a name.</p><br>

Step 6:<h2> Upload Your Code to Github</h2>
<p>
Now that you have a repository, you can upload your code to Github. You can do this by cloning your repository to your local machine and then pushing your code to Github using Git.
<br>
 Alternatively, you can also upload your code directly to Github using the Github website.
Uploading files to Github is an essential part of collaborating with others or backing up your projects.</p>
<br> 
<h2>Here are the steps to upload files to Github using the (Upload) feature</h2>
<p>To upload files <br>
<br>
1: Go on your newly created  repository<br>
<br>
2: Upload files<br>
<br>
Once you have created the repository, you can upload files by selecting the "Upload files" button from the repository's homepage ( or (...) button). This will open the file uploader, where you can drag and drop your files or click the "choose your files" button to select the files manually.</p>
<br>
<p>3: Add files and commit changes<br>
<br>
After selecting the files you want to upload, you will see a preview of the changes you made. You can add a description or commit message to the changes if you want to describe your changes. Finally, click the "Commit changes" button to upload your files to Github.</p>
<br>
<p>4: Verify uploaded files<br>
<br>
Once you have uploaded the files, you can verify that the files are in your repository by going to your repository's homepage. You can click on each file to view its contents and make any necessary changes.</p>
<br>
 <p>5: commit changes to the repository</p>
<br>
<p>Step 6: Publish Your Website with Github Pages</p>
<br>
<p>Github Pages is a feature that allows you to publish your website directly from your Github repository. </p>
<br>
<p>To use Github Pages, go to your repository settings and scroll down to the "Github Pages" section. From there, you can choose a source for your website (e.g., the master branch) and select a theme for your website. Once you have done this, your website will be published and can be accessed by anyone on the internet.</p>
