     <h1>Guide on how to buy shares  in kenya</h1>
    <p>Investing in shares is an excellent way to grow your wealth over the long term. However, buying shares can be a daunting task, especially if you're new to investing. In this step-by-step guide, we'll take you through the process of buying shares in Kenya.</p><br>

<p>Step 1:<b> Get a CDS account</b>
The first step to buying shares in Kenya is to open a Central Depository System (CDS) account. This account will hold all the shares you purchase and ensure that they are secure. To open a CDS account, visit any stockbrokerage firm in Kenya, such as:<br><br> 1. AIB-AXYS Africa Limited P.O. Box 43676 -00100, Nairobi <br><br>

2. Kingdom Securities Limited P.O. Box 48231-00100, Nairobi <br><br>
3. Old Mutual Securities Limited P.O. Box 50338-00200, Nairobi <br><br>
Ask for the forms needed to open a CDS account.<br><br>
Alternatively  you can visit  your bank and tell them you want to buy shares they will advice  your on a good stockbrokerage  firm or refer you to their  subsidiaries that deal with stocks.<br><br>

You'll need to provide your stockbroker with your CDS account number and the amount you want to transfer or transfer  the funds using mpesa.  A paybill will  usually  be provided. 
<br><br>
Step 4:<b> Place an order(Buying the actual shares)</b>
One way of placing  orders is by requesting  your stockbroker  to purchase  specific  shares on your  account on your behalf or purchase  the shares directly  through  an online trading  platform  or application provided  by your stockbroker. <br><br>
Shares in kenya are bought  in lots of 100. meaning  that if you want to buy Safaricom plc shares  you need to buy 100 of them at your specified  price.On 10<sup>th</sup> May Safaricom's  share price is 15.30 ksh.
So you will need 1,530 ksh to buy the shares.
