      <h1>A Step-by-Step Guide to Publishing Your Website to the Internet</h1>
   Publishing a website on the internet can be an exciting and rewarding experience. Not only can you share your content with the world, but you can also showcase your technical skills by creating and publishing your website from scratch. In this article, we will go through the steps of how to publish a website on the internet, starting from coding in VS Code to using Github Pages.<br>
<br>

Step 1: Choose Your Tools<br>
<br>
The first step to creating a website is to choose the right tools for the job. While there are many web development tools available, we recommend using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> (VS Code) as your code editor. VS Code is a free, open-source code editor that is widely used by web developers. It comes with many useful features, including syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools. For android you can use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teejay.trebedit">treb edit</a><br>
<br>
Step 2: Write Your Code<br>
<br>
Once you have chosen your code editor, it's time to start writing your code. You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create your website. HTML is used for the structure of the website, CSS is used for styling, and JavaScript is used for interactivity.<br>
<br>
Step 3: Test Your Website Locally<br>
<br>
Before publishing your website, it's important to test it locally to ensure that everything is working correctly. You can do this by opening your HTML file in a web browser. This will give you a preview of how your website will look and behave when it's published.<br>
<br>
Step 4: Create a Github Account.<a href="https://www.pioneerblogspot.co.ke/step-by-step-website-publishing.html">read more</a> <br>

      <h1> do not fall for these instagram scams</h1>
   <br>

   <br>
1.crypto scams<br>
Cryptocurrency has become increasingly popular over the years, with more people investing in digital assets. However, this rise in popularity has also led to an increase in crypto scams on Instagram. In this article, we will discuss the most common crypto scams on Instagram and how you can avoid them.<br>
<br>
a.Fake Crypto Giveaways<br>
<br>
Fake crypto giveaways are one of the most common scams on Instagram. In this scam, fraudsters create fake social media accounts that look like popular crypto influencers or companies. They then promote fake giveaways where users can win cryptocurrency by following their accounts, sharing their posts, or sending them a small amount of cryptocurrency as a "verification fee." However, once the victims send the cryptocurrency, they never receive the promised rewards.<br>
<br>
b.Investment Scams<br>
<br>
Investment scams are also common on Instagram, where fraudsters offer high returns on investment in crypto. They use social media to promote their investment schemes and attract investors. However, once the victims invest their money, the fraudsters disappear, and the victims lose their money. why would  some ask you for money and triple  it within minutes?if they had the means  to triple money they wouldn't be in your dm asking for money. never give money without due diligence .<a href="https://www.pioneerblogspot.co.ke/common-instagram-scams.html">read more</a> <br>
