        <h1>Why you should  journal </h1>
        <p>Did you know that if you start journaling today you would have something in common with Albert Einstein , Marcus Auralius and Leonardo da Vinci? Owning a journal can be beneficial to you and this article is going to show you how but first let's go through the types of journals/journaling there is.</p><br>

<h2>Types of journals/journaling</h2>

<p><b>Stream of consciousness journal</b> - this type of journal is used to write whatever thoughts that come to your mind. It does not matter if they are not in order, just write it all out. This is beneficial for when you want to get things off your chest especially when you are angry or frustrated.</p><br>
<p>
<b>Food journal</b>- do you want to keep track of your eating habits? Then this is the journal for you. You can write what you want to eat ,when to eat and  what you've been eating . Sometimes people stress eat and in this state they can eat things that do not align with their diet goals. Keeping a food journal can reveal the moments you stress eat and through this you can dig deep and find out what causes you stress and how you can mitigate the stress so as not to find yourself eating junk.</p><br>

<p><b>Fitness journal</b>- this one helps you keep track of your fitness journey.</p><br>
<p>
<b>Dream journal</b>- if you want to know your dreams and what they might mean then this is the journal for you. You write down your dreams if you can remember them, immediately after waking up as you can forget them if you stay for long without writing them.</p><br>

<p><b>Gratitude journal</b>-
To-do list- you can write down the things you'd like to do during the day. They can be written the night before the day or early in the morning.</p><br>

<p><b>Sketch journal</b>- in this you can doodle and draw and tap in into your imagination through art.</p><br>
 
<p>Now that we've gotten a sense of the types of journals there are, let's get into the real deal; the benefits of keeping a journal.</p><br>

 <h2>Benefits of keeping a journal</h2>

<p>It is <b> good for your mental health</b>
owning a journal can have a positive effect on your mental well-being. It has been said to help with mental health problems for example depression. A journal is a safe place where you can write your fears, pains and frustrations without fear of being judged. Think of it as your therapist. Writing down your emotions has a positive effect because not only do you gain clarity after writing, but  you also calm down and reduce stress. It is better to write those emotions down instead of bottling them up and risk them eating you up from inside .</p><br>

<p>It<b> keeps your thoughts organized</b>
When you write out your thoughts, even if it was a stream of consciousness kind of journaling your thoughts becomes organized. If you weren't sure about a situation or what solution to apply to a problem you were facing you might have an answer after journaling. You cannot see your reflection in boiling water, you have to let the water settle down first. Likewise if you want to solve a problem you cannot do it while your thoughts are in turmoil/disorganized and journaling helps you achieve the first step of solving your problems.<p><br>

<p><b>Self-reflection</b>
Keeping a journal can serve as a self reflection tool. When you write down your feelings, thoughts and experiences you gain a deeper understanding of yourself. You get to know what your personal values are, identify what matters to you and your emotional triggers. This can help in self- growth and aligning your goals with your personal values. Reading your past journal entries can also reveal unhealthy patterns and negative attributes about yourself and by realizing this you can take the necessary steps to be a better version of yourself if not the best.</p><br>

<p><b>It improves memory</b>
Keeping a journal does improve your memory as you can go back to past entries and remember something you might have forgotten. It keeps you from forgetting things. You can also write important dates in it for example the birthday dates of your friends or when an important event is going to take place so that you don't forget.</p><br>

<p><b>Record of ideas</b>
Many a times we have ideas that come to our minds when we are just going about our business and then we forget them. When you have a journal you can write down all the ideas that come to you as soon as they do.</p><br>

<p>It <b>improves writing and communication skills </b>
Keeping a journal involves writing and when you do it frequently your writing skills are bound to improve. You get to learn how to express yourself in a clear and concise way henceforth improving your communication skills. This might be a good thing in your relationships and friendships.</p><br>
<p><b>Emotional release</b>
As I have stated above a journal acts as an emotional outlet. It provides a safe and private space to express your feelings and thoughts without judgement. Writing down your emotions can help you process them, alleviate stress and improve your overall well being.</p>
<br>
 

<p>Journals are very helpful tools and you can choose which way you want them to be; digital or traditional. The traditional one which by the way means a physical one, the book, is the best for you if you would like to reduce your screen time. The digital one also has its own benefits. You may not always carry your journal that is in book form and something might come up that requires you to journal and this is when having a journal in your phone, tablet or laptop comes in handy. You can have a digital one or a traditional one or both. Hopefully this article has persuaded you to go get one if you don't. Happy journaling!</p>
