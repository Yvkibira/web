   <h2>How  to make an executive  summary  for your software engineering project.</h2>
   <p>An executive summary is a short and straight to the point overview of what you have done in your project. It is  written for short presentations  during class time and gives the teacher  general  information because  you cannot present  the entire  project  in one sitting. It helps the one being presented to understand the key points and recommendations.These are some of the guidelines on how to write an executive  summary:<br>
<br>
1.Start with a quick introduction that provides context your software project.<br>
<br>
2.Recognize the main problem  that the project  solves.<br>
<br>
3.Summarize the key findings, conclusions, and recommendations.<br>
<br>
4.Use applications like Microsoft 365 to create pie charts, tables, graphs and power  point presentations  that present your data in a clear and brief manner.<br>
<br>
5.Keep the language simple,and easy to understand do not use fancy words that need  to be looked up to understand.<br>
<br>
6.Use active voice  like we have written  come up with this project  to...and avoid lengthy sentences.
Limit the summary to one or two pages, depending on the length of the document containg your project.<br>
<br>
Remember, the goal of an executive summary is to provide a high-level overview of the document that contains  the project  and helps to save time.
