     <h2>How  to make an executive  summary </h2> <p>An executive summary is a brief and concise overview of a larger document or report. It is typically written for busy executives and decision-makers who may not have time to read the entire document but still need to understand the key points and recommendations. Here are some general guidelines on how to write an executive summary:<br>
<br>
1.Start with a brief introduction that provides context for the document or report.<br>
<br>
2.Identify the main problem or issue that the document or report addresses.<br>
<br>
3.Summarize the key findings, conclusions, and recommendations.<br>
<br>
4.Use bullet points, tables, or graphs to present key data or information in a clear and concise manner.<br>
<br>
5.Keep the language simple, jargon-free, and easy to understand.<br>
<br>
6.Use active voice and avoid lengthy sentences.
Limit the summary to one or two pages, depending on the length of the document or report.<br>
<br>
Remember, the goal of an executive summary is to provide a high-level overview of the document or report that helps busy executives and decision-makers make informed decisions quickly and efficiently.
