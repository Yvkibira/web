 <h1> To send work to a teacher using Lucidchart, follow these steps:</h1>

Create the work you want to send to your teacher in Lucidchart. This could be a UML diagram, a flowchart, a mind map, or any other type of visual aid that you want to share with your teacher.<br>
<br>

Once you have created your work, click on the "Share" button in the top-right corner of the screen.<br>
<br>

In the sharing options, select "Invite People."<br>
<br>

Enter your teacher's email address in the "Invite people" field. You can also add a message to your teacher if you wish.<br>
<br>

Select the permissions you want to give your teacher. You can choose to allow them to edit the document, comment on it, or just view it.<br>
<br>

Click on the "Send" button to invite your teacher to collaborate on the document.<br>
<br>

Your teacher will receive an email invitation to join the document. Once they accept the invitation, they will be able to view and edit the document as permitted by the permissions you set.<br>
<br>

You can also check the status of your teacher's collaboration by clicking on the "Share" button and selecting "Shared with Me." This will show you who has access to the document and their level of access.<br>
<br>

That's it! By following these steps, you can easily share your work with your teacher using Lucidchart.<br>
