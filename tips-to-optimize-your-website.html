     <h1>Discover the Best Ways to Improve Your Website's Performance</h1>
	<p>So you have just finished making your website and uploaded it to the web, here are some useful tips to make use of:</p>
	
	<h2>1. Convert your images to .webp format</h2>
	<p>Png and jpeg photos take up a lot of space, which can slow down your website. By using a free online tool like Convertio, you can quickly convert your images to .webp format, which is optimized for web use and loads much faster.</p>

	<h2>2. Track website visits and get daily insights with Google Analytics</h2>
	<p>By adding Google Analytics tags to your website, you can track user behavior, measure engagement, and get insights into what's working and what's not. This will help you make data-driven decisions to improve your website's performance and user experience.</p>

	<h2>3. Make your website discoverable by submitting a sitemap to Google Search Console</h2>
	<p>Sitemaps provide a roadmap of your website's structure and hierarchy, which helps search engines crawl and index your content more effectively. Use a free sitemap generator like XML Sitemap Generator to create your sitemap, then upload it to your website's hosting server and submit it to Google Search Console. This will help your website appear in search results and increase its visibility.</p>

	<h2>4. Create a professional-looking logo for your website using Small SEO Tools Designer</h2>
	<p>A logo is an essential part of your website's branding and can help you stand out from the competition. With Small SEO Tools Designer, you can easily create custom logos and posters that fit your website's style and tone. After making a logo, add a favicon. Favicons offer several practical benefits like Bookmark Recognition, Visual Differentiation, and Brand Recognition.</p>

	<h2>5. Measure your website's SEO performance with Seobility</h2>
	<p>Seobility is a free online tool that analyzes your website's content, structure, and technical elements to give you actionable insights into how to improve your SEO. By using Seobility regularly, you can avoid common SEO mistakes and optimize your website for better rankings and visibility.</p>

	<h2>6. Ensure accessibility</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Use descriptive and meaningful text for links: Use text that describes the link destination rather than generic phrases like "click here" or "read more." This helps users who rely on screen readers or who have cognitive disabilities.</li>
		<li>Use alt tags for images: Alt tags provide a text description of the image and help users with visual impairments understand the content.</li>
		<li>Use proper heading hierarchy: Use headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.).</li>
		<li>Use high-contrast colors: Use high-contrast colors between text and background to make it easier for users with low vision to read the content.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>7. Name links properly</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Use descriptive and relevant anchor text: Make sure the anchor text accurately describes the linked page's content, and uses relevant keywords to help search engines understand the page's topic.</li>
		<li>Avoid generic anchor text: Don't use vague or generic phrases like "click here" or "read more" as anchor text. Instead, use descriptive phrases that give the user a clear idea of where the link will

 take them.</li>
		<li>Keep it concise: Try to keep your anchor text brief and to the point. Long or overly complicated anchor text can confuse both users and search engines.</li>
		<li>Use hyphens or underscores to separate words: If your anchor text includes multiple words, use hyphens or underscores to separate them. This can help search engines better understand the meaning of the phrase.</li>
		<li>Avoid using too many exact match keywords: While it's important to use relevant keywords in your anchor text, avoid stuffing your links with too many exact match keywords. This can be seen as spammy by search engines and may hurt your rankings.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>8. Add titles to links</h2>
	<p>When adding a title to a hyperlink using the HTML anchor tag, there are a few rules to keep in mind:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The title attribute must be enclosed in double quotes (") or single quotes (').</li>
		<li>The text used for the title should provide additional information about the content that the link leads to and should be concise and descriptive.</li>
		<li>The title should not be the same as the visible text of the hyperlink, as it should provide additional information, not repeat the same information.</li>
		<li>The title attribute is optional, but it is good practice to include it as it can help improve accessibility and provide a better user experience.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>9. Add Structured Data</h2>
	<p>Structured data, such as JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) and Microdata, provides search engines with additional information about your website's content. By implementing structured data markup, you can help search engines understand and interpret your website more effectively. This, in turn, can lead to rich search engine results, such as featured snippets, knowledge panels, and more prominent visibility in search engine result pages (SERPs).</p>

	<h2>10. Include a 404 Page</h2>
	<p>A 404 page is displayed when a user tries to access a page on your website that doesn't exist. Instead of leaving users stranded with an error message, create a custom 404 page that guides them back to relevant content on your website. This page should be user-friendly, visually appealing, and provide clear navigation options. It's an opportunity to engage with visitors, prevent them from leaving your site, and potentially convert their interest into exploration of other valuable pages.</p>

	<h2>11. Monitor 404 Errors in Search Console</h2>
	<p>A website's performance can be affected by various factors, including server issues or broken links that lead to 404 errors. Regularly monitoring these errors using tools like Google Search Console is essential. It allows you to identify and fix any issues promptly. Additionally, monitoring the Search Console can help you uncover potential hosting problems or technical glitches that might impact your website's visibility in search results. By staying vigilant and resolving such issues swiftly, you can ensure a smooth user experience and maintain a positive impression with search engines.</p>
