     <h1>How to pursue computer degree  without a computer</h1>
     <p>It is possible to pursue an Information Technology (IT) degree without owning a computer. While coding is a part of the curriculum, it is not the only aspect of learning. This article provides insights on how you can learn coding without a computer.<br>
<br>
Here are some tips:
<br>
One of the first languages you may learn is C programming. CodeBlocks is a popular application for installation on a computer. However, you can use an alternative mobile application called Cxxdroid, which is free and available on the Google Play Store.<br>
<br>
If you want to learn C++, Cxxdroid has you covered as well.<br>
<br>
Java is another programming language you may learn. JShell-Java IDE is a mobile application that provides an alternative IDE to use. You can download it from the Google Play Store.<br>
<br>
To write JavaScript code on your mobile device, you can use Treb Edit, also available on the Google Play Store. This application allows you to write CSS, JavaScript, and HTML.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, owning a computer is not a requirement for pursuing an IT degree. With the use of alternative mobile applications, you can learn coding and programming languages on the go.<br></p>
