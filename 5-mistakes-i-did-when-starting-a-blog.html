     <h1>5 mistakes i did when starting a blog </h1>
     <img src="https://www.pioneerblogspot.co.ke/5-mistakes.png" alt="mistakes when starting a  blog website"style="width: 300px; height:300px;"><br>
     <ol>
          <li><h2>naming urls(links)</h2> </li><p>My First ever mistake  was in nameing the urls of my blogs I would name my urls in formats like blog1.html, blog 2.html, blog 3 ...I would later learn the url should be  short consice and descriptive of the content. example my-first-blogging-mistakes.html</p><br>
 <li><h2>Not making and submitting sitemaps </h2></li><p>Having researched how to  know how many people  saw my website  and how many blogs they read  I signed up for a google analytics  account. When monitoring  the data it would come to my attention  that my website had more traffic  coming from direct sources because  I would share relevant  articles to groups and  share to friends  and little  to no traffic  from organic  sources.After researching the problem I was informed of google search  console google which is a site built for web developers. What was needed  was to   create a sitemap (put all of my url into one document) which would help google discover my site and index the urls(make the blog article urls available to users when they query searches). later on I would discover that one has to make  another sitemap for images found in the website. Bing also has a tool that you can submit a sitemap to increase chances of appearing in the bing search results.</p>

</div>
  <li><h2>Not using a  content management  system(cms) </h2></li><p>This website  is powered by raw html and css code.All the techical details  of web development I learnt while setting  up this website.Do not worry if you find technical terms used in the blog. There are great tutorials on YouTube and content management system plugins to solve the issues. After finishing the design of the website  then came the journey of creating and publishing content on the website. Since I did not have a cms like WordPress I had to copy the format  of my website  each time i had to make a post and when  there were required  changes affecting  all pages I would have to to make changes to every individual page which was time consuming and  repetitive. At that time the idea of getting  a cms was non existent to me But as the content grows on the website a need for a cms grows stronger.</p>

    <li><h2>Structured data</h2></li>
    <p>While reading  news articles  and blogs from at well designed websites i would delve deeper into their source code and look at the qualities of a good website. I would encounter code that was simple to read but very foreign syntax.<a href="">learn about structured data. </a> The structurred data is a way of adding additional context and meaning in relation to the webpages content. Structured data increases a websites visibility in the search engine results page.</p>
  <li><h2>Search engine optimization (SEO) mistakes</h2></li>
  <ul>
      <li>No follow tags-while looking for ways to monetize the website you might  venture into affiliate  marketing. On the affiliate  marketing  links that you promote  make sure to add no follow tags to avoid being penalized.Many websites  that have affiliate  links have affiliate  Disclaimers</li>

<li>Using wrong keywords and keyword stuffing:
Using irrelevant or incorrect keywords can lead to low-quality traffic or no traffic at all. Keyword stuffing, which is the excessive use of keywords in content with the intent of manipulating search rankings, is a black-hat SEO tactic that can result in penalties from search engines.</li>

<li>Lack of titles in links:
Using descriptive and relevant anchor text (titles in links) helps search engines understand the context of the linked page and improves the user experience. Not having proper titles in links can make it difficult for both search engines and users to know where the link leads.</li>

<li>Not putting images in the content or not optimizing them:
Images can add value to your content and improve engagement. However, not using images or failing to optimize them properly can impact the user experience and slow down page loading times, affecting SEO.</li>

<li>Not putting Open Graphs and Twitter meta tags:
Open Graph and Twitter meta tags are important for social media sharing. They allow you to control how your content appears when shared on platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Without these tags, social media platforms may not display the content optimally, leading to missed opportunities for engagement.</li>

<li>Not promoting on social media:
Social media is a powerful tool for driving traffic, increasing brand awareness, and engaging with your audience. Neglecting to promote your content on social media can result in missed opportunities for reaching a wider audience and potential customers.</li>

<li> No favicons:
Favicons are small icons that appear in the browser tab or next to the page title in bookmarks. They are a visual representation of your website and help users easily identify and return to your site. Not having a favicon may not directly impact SEO, but it can make your site appear less professional and memorable to users.</li>
