  <h1>Why you should read nothing lasts forever by Sidney Sheldon</h1>
  <p>A thriller/suspense novel by renowned author,<b> Sidney Sheldon</b>, published in 1994.</p><br>
  <p>It is a story about the lives of three women: Paige Taylor, Kat Hunter, and Honey Taft, soon after they begin their residence in Embarcadero County Hospital.</p><br>
  <p>The prologue of the novel takes us through a court proceeding in which Paige is being tried for murder, a murder to which she admits to committing and one which the evidence presented seems to point a finger at her as the murderer. This leaves the reader in suspense as to what happened when beginning the first chapter of the novel.</p><br>
  <p>The author is known for writing gripping, fast-paced stories with elements of mystery, suspense, and intrigue, and "Nothing Lasts Forever" is no different.</p><br>
  <p>The themes of power and corruption, justice and revenge, betrayal and trust, morality and ethics, and resilience and survival are brought about by the story. Betrayal is a recurring theme as characters deceive and manipulate one another for their own purposes.</p><br>
  <p>The characters in the story show the importance of trust and the consequences of broken trust in personal and professional relationships.</p><br>
  <p>The storyline is smooth and intriguing; you won't even notice that you've been reading for 5 hours straight. The author takes you through the past lives of the characters and how they have affected their present selves.</p><br>
  <p>As for weaknesses, I don't suppose there's any flaw other than it being too perfect.</p><br>
  <p>Personally, the novel entertained me and made me think and challenge my perspectives about life, and for another, it might resonate with them emotionally.</p><br>
  <p>This is a must-read for anyone who loves a good mystery novel and a page-turner at that.</p><br>
