     <h2>How to fix connected without  Internet  on zuku wifi.</h2>
     <p>Are you having issues with your Zuku WiFi? Here are some steps to follow to log in to your router and troubleshoot any problems you may be experiencing.<br>
<br>
first try  to clear your routers cache. this is by pressing  the reset  button  for 20 seconds located  on the back of your router<br>
<br>
if that does not work, go to your device's settings and navigate to the WiFi section. Locate your WiFi name and click on the gear logo next to its image. Then, click on the manage router.<br>
<br>
A login page will appear. This is specifically for Zuku WiFi, which uses the Technicolor router. Leave the username blank and use admin as your password.<br>
<br>
Next, click on connection and check if the connectivity state and boot state are both showing "OK". If they are not, try to correct them by switching off your router for ten minutes and unplugging it completely from the power source.<br>
<br>
If the DS and US lights on your router are blinking fast or not blinking at all, give it ten minutes. If the blinking doesn't stop, contact Zuku for further assistance.<br>
<br>
By following these steps, you can easily troubleshoot any issues you may be experiencing with your Zuku WiFi.<br>
