<br>

Step 2: Once you've accessed the login page, leave the username blank and use "admin" as the password to sign in to your router.<br>
<br>

Step 3: Click on the "Wireless" tab on the top side and then click on "Primary Network" on the left side. This will give you access to change your Wi-Fi name and password.<br>

Step 4: On the screen that appears, change the network name (SSID) to your preferred name. On the WPA Pre-shared Key, click "Show Key" to display the current Wi-Fi password. Change it to your preferred password and click "Apply."<br>
<br>

If you encounter any issues while changing your Wi-Fi name and password, contact Zuku for assistance.<br>
