  <h1>how to connect custom domain from host pinnacle to your Github hosted site</h1>
 <br>
A domain is a unique identifier that represents a website or an online resource on the internet. It is the part of a URL that comes after the "www." and before the top-level domain extension (such as ".com" or ".org"). For example, in the URL "www.example.com", "example" is the domain name.<br>
<br>
Domains are needed because they provide a human-readable and memorable way to access websites and online resources. Without domains, we would have to remember and enter complex IP addresses (a series of numbers) to access a website or online resource. Domains make it easier for people to find and access websites, and they also allow businesses and individuals to establish a unique online identity and brand.<br>
<br>
Domains are also important for website owners because they can affect search engine rankings, website traffic, and overall online visibility. A well-chosen and well-promoted domain name can help attract more visitors to a website, while a poorly chosen or obscure domain name can make it difficult for people to find and remember a website. Additionally, owning a domain name gives website owners control over their online presence and enables them to create professional email addresses and custom branding for their online business or personal website.<br>
<br>
<b>GitHub Pages</b> is a great option to host a website without spending a dime on web hosting fees. However, by default, GitHub Pages provides a subdomain for your website. But, you may prefer to use your own domain name instead of a subdomain provided by GitHub Pages. Luckily, you can connect your custom domain to your GitHub Pages site easily.<br>
<br>
In this blog, we will guide you through the steps to connect your custom domain to your GitHub Pages site.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 1:</b> <h2>Purchase a Domain Name</h2>
<br>
First and foremost, you need to purchase a domain name from a domain registrar. A popular domain registrars in kenya is  <a href="https://www.hostpinnacle.co.ke/">HostPinnacle</a>The price of a domain name varies depending on the extension and the domain registrar you choose. Once you have purchased your domain name, you need to log in to hostpinnacle's client login  dashboard . You will find  your information  and the domain you purchased.Click on your domain and check if it is active if not make a ticket and ask them to activate your domain.<br>
<br>
<b> Step 2:</b><h3> Configure DNS Settings</h3><br>
<br>
Next, you need to configure the DNS settings for your domain. You need to add a CNAME or A record to your DNS settings to point your custom domain to your GitHub Pages site.<br>
<br>
below are the general  procedures  to connect  your site to Github   to your custom domain follow the following:<br>
<br><div style=" background-color:#ccc;">
- Add a CNAME record if you want to use a subdomain (e.g., www.yourdomain.com).<br>
<br>
  - In the Name or Host field, enter your subdomain (e.g., www).<br>
  <br>
  - In the Value or Points to field, enter your GitHub Pages URL (e.g., yourusername.github.io).<br>
  <br>
- Add an A record if you want to use the root domain (e.g., yourdomain.com).<br>
<br>
  - In the Name or Host field, enter your root domain (e.g., yourdomain.com).<br>
  <br>
  - In the Value or Points to field, enter the IP address of GitHub's servers (185.199.108.153, 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, 185.199.111.153).<br>
  <br>
  </div>
For hostpinnacle what you need to do is  open a ticket  then write your cname records and ask them  to add your cname records .<br>
  <br>
<b> Tip:</b>Be sure to include the trailing period at the end of your Github page (yourusername.github.io.)Which i have identified to be causing an issue.<br>
  <br>
<b>your message  should  look like this</b><br>
<br>
<div style=" background-color:#ccc;">
   <b>Cname records :</b><br>
Host name =example.co.ke<br>
Value=example.github.io.<br>

<br>
<b> A records:</b><br>
In the "Name" field, enter @ :<br><br>
In the "Value" field, enter the IP address of GitHub Pages: 185.199.108.153, 185.199.109.153, 185.199.110.153, 185.199.111.153<br>
 </div>
 <br> 
Your ticket  will be answered  and the changes will take effect. you will now be able to use  your new domain name.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 3: </b><h4>Configure GitHub Pages</h4><br>
<br>
Once you have configured the DNS settings, you need to configure your GitHub Pages site to use your custom domain. Follow these steps:<br>
<br>
1. In your GitHub repository, click on the Settings tab.<br>
2. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.<br>
3. In the Custom domain field, enter your custom domain name (e.g., yourdomain.com).<br>
4. Click Save.<br>
<br>
<b>Step 4:</b><h5> Wait for DNS Propagation</h5><br>
<br>
DNS propagation is the time it takes for your DNS changes to take effect. It usually takes a few hours, but it can take up to 48 hours for the changes to propagate worldwide. During this time, your website may be inaccessible or may display a GitHub Pages default page.<br>
<br>
<b> Step 5: </b><h6>Enjoy Your Custom Domain</h6><br>
<br>
Once the DNS propagation is complete, you can access your website using your custom domain name. Congratulations, you have successfully connected your custom domain to your GitHub Pages site.<br>
<br>
connecting your custom domain to your GitHub Pages site is a straightforward process. By following the steps outlined above, you can use your own domain name for your GitHub Pages site.<br>
