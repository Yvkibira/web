     <h2>How  to come up  with requirements in software engineering</h2> <p> As a software engineering student, coming up with requirements for your projects can be a challenging task. Here are some steps to help you get started:<br>
     <br>
1.Identify the problem or opportunity: Start by identifying the problem or opportunity that your project will address. This could be a need in a particular industry, a gap in existing software solutions, or an opportunity to improve a business process.<br>
<br>
2.Define the scope: Define the scope of your project, including the features, functionality, and user requirements. This will help you to narrow down the focus of your project and ensure that you are meeting the needs of your target audience.<br>
<br>3.Conduct research: Conduct research to identify the best practices and technologies that can be used to address the problem or opportunity you have identified. This can involve conducting user surveys, market research, and competitive analysis.<br>
<br>4.Develop use cases: Develop use cases that describe how your software will be used in real-life situations. This will help you to identify the features and functionality that are needed to meet the needs of your target audience.<br>
<br>5.Create a requirements document: Based on your research and use cases, create a requirements document that outlines the key features, functionality, and user requirements for your software project. This document should be used as a guide throughout the development process to ensure that you are meeting the needs of your target audience.<br>
<br>By following these steps, you can develop a clear set of requirements for your software project that will help you to build a solution that meets the needsof  your users.
